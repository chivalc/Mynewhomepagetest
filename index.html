        A bit about me. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am Chiedu, married with children and of African Heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a couple of hobbies but the ones that stand out the
        most are learning, technology, fast cars though I do not have one yet.
      </p>
        From an early age I have been interested in information technology. I
        recall the feeling of wanting to know how computers worked, why they
        worked and what else they could do. After graduating from secondary
        school, I sought employment in a document support centre using Microsoft
        office tools, Corel Draw, AutoCad and the likes to prepare and beautify
        documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        This interest never left me, rather, it grew more profound,
        and I became more passionate with every new discovery I made - from
        communicating with artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the
        internet for the first time. Technology has left me fascinated with just
        how much power yet mystery they hold. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in computing has never been restricted. I have used the knowledge that I have gained over the
        past years and with support from friends and family to start delving
        into the information technology world properly and I am hopeful that I
        will be gainfully employed and possibly set up my own technology related
        business in the future. The more information I find gives me new
        perspective on how certain things function. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Enrolling into the Code Your
        Future Programme has been a great opportunity for rediscovery. Coding
        was a totally alien experience for me, but over the last weeks, since
        the start of the Code Your Future Programme application process, I have
        done a lot of research and planned, and finally approaching the
        completion of my application process I am beginning to feel the
        satisfaction of knowing that I have the rare opportunity that most
        people would wish they had. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure that I can fit everything in my
        personal life, part time job and this new developmental endeavour, I
        have had to develop very good time management and prioritising skills. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have enjoyed enormous support so far from Code Your Future trainers and
        I like the idea of being part of a supportive family engaging with
        people who accept and support one another in challenging and successful
        times. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the idea of creating long-term, measurable impact in
        society which I am now a beneficiary of. In the future I will like to
        contribute in helping people make tangible, positive changes in their
        lives by improving their social mobility and reducing inequality. I
        believe in community and giving back, and I am hopeful that someday I
        will be able to contribute my quota to the prosperity of the Code Your
        Future Programme and the future cohort that will enrol into the program.
        I will also spread the good news of CYF to all that are interested. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking forward with great anticipation to the challenges that studying
        with Code Your Future will bring.
